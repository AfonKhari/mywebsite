My research draws on an interdisciplinary background that bridges **cognitive science**, **neuroscience**, **philosophy**, and **linguistics**.

I'm particularly interested in how humans attend to, process, and make sense of the world, both through language and in response to internal and environmental dynamics.  
Some of my main research areas include:

- **Attentional control and decision-making** in complex and noisy environments  
- **Speech-to-song illusion** and the perceptual boundaries between speech and music  
- **Sleep quality and cognitive variability**, modeled using **Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM)**  
- **Computational modeling** of cognitive strategies and attentional shifts  
- **Philosophy of cognition and mind**, especially where it intersects with emerging technologies and education  
- **Language, narrative, and embodiment** , how stories, rhythm, and movement shape understanding  
- **Science communication and pedagogy**, particularly within interdisciplinary and multilingual contexts

I currently collaborate with the **Music Cognition Group** at the ILLC and the **Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics Lab** at the Donders Institute.

This evolving research portfolio reflects my belief that cognition is not just a brain-bound process but one deeply entangled with culture, context, and communication.
